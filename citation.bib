abstract="Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state of the art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.",

abstract = {Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are an important tool used by software engineering researchers to summarize the state of knowledge about a particular topic. Currently, SLR authors must perform the difficult, time-consuming task in largely manual fashion. To identify barriers faced by SLR authors, we conducted an interactive community workshop prior to ESEM'13. Workshop participants generated a total of 100 ideas that, through group discussions, formed 37 composite barriers to the SLR process. Further analysis reveals the barriers relate to latent themes regarding the SLR process, primary studies, the practitioner community, and tooling. This paper describes the barriers identified during the workshop along with a ranking of those barriers that is based on votes by workshop attendees. The paper concludes by describing the impact of these barriers on three important constituencies: SLR Methodology Researchers, SLR Authors and SLR consumers.},

abstract = {The systematic analysis of related work is an important part of every research project. Surprisingly, especially in computer science, this activity is typically performed manually. Whilst in other disciplines fully automated analysis approaches exist, the lack of a reasonably complete, queryable and free-to-use literature catalog for computer science requires computer scientists to manually retrieve, merge and analyze literature from different catalogs. Although manual literature retrieval is enforced by the current main publishers, tool support to merge and cleanse literature found in different catalogs as well as to analyze the results is possible and needed. The systematic literature review toolkit, an Eclipse Rich Client Platform application leveraging the Eclipse Modeling Framework, aims to provide this support. Currently, four main features are supported: simple literature filtering, design of a taxonomy, classification of literature and analysis of the classification by generated diagrams. The tool is available online: https://github.com/sebastiangoetz/slr-toolkit},
